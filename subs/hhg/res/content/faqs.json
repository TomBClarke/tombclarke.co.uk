For those working, Housing Benefit reduces on a sliding scale depending upon how much you earn.  When you apply to Lawrence House or get a job, staff will give you an idea of how much rent you will need to pay.  The full rent is £209.35 per week."},
        {"question": "What happens when it's time for me to move out?", "answer": "Your key worker will have been working with you throughout your stay to plan your move on and will try to help you identify further alternative accommodation. The pathway linked service for move on from Lawrence House is the Wykin Project in Hinckley; alternatively, this move may be to a tenancy with a Housing Association or Private Landlord. In this case we can assist you with claiming the relevant grants and loans to furnish the property and we will offer continuing short term support after you have left to ensure that you are coping."}
