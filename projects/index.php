                    <p>As charity work, I have been working on a new website for Hinckley Homeless Group. For now, this link here is so the directors can see what I've done to see if they'd like to use it as the full site in place of what they currently have.</p>
                    <p>It is therefore worth noting that because this is effectively a development version lots of this could change, and at request will. To me, an important part of this website is to be mobile compatible, so please do view the website on a normal PC and a mobile phone to experience it in both 'modes'.</p>

                <h2>Majestic Summer Internship 2015 - <a href="majestic">View here</a></h2>
                <div class="section">

                    <p>Myself, <a target="_blank" href="http://mishawagner.co.nf">Misha Wagner</a> and Rowan Cole worked as a team at Majestic to create interesting data visualisations using D3.js. Majsetic also hired a journalist, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/pupulchatterjee">Pupul Chatterjee</a>, to write blogs about what we created. Through out the 10 weeks, we used HTML, CSS, PHP, Java, JavaScript with D3 and, of course, the Majestic API.</p>
                    <p>My favourite projects from the experience was 'Round The Clock', 'The Majestic Universe', 'MRacing' and (to be announced). While MRacing was built using canvas elements in HTML 5, all of the projects taught me a lot about how to handle the large amount of data we were getting back from the Majestic API, process it using JavaScript and display it using D3. MRacing was also a great learning curve as it was the largest game I'd ever worked on, along with using canvas elements which was also new to me.</p>
                    <p>I was also given the opportunity to go to Leeds Hack (leedshack.org) to represent Majestic as a sponsor, where I introduced Majestic to the attendees, was on hand to set hackers up with Majestic accounts, act as technical support and have discussions with them about what they could do as projects, and was responsible for selecting winner for our prizes and awarding them.</p>
