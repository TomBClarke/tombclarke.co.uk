                <p>Hi, I'm Tom, and I'm currently studying at the University of Birmingham to get a degree in Computer Science. As well as the programs and projects I do inside of my degree, I also enjoy working on things outside of my course, which is what I want to show here. You can check out my <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/tombclarke">LinkedIn</a> and my <a href="res/files/CV.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
