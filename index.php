                <p>Hi, I'm Tom, and I'm currently studying at the University of Birmingham to get a degree in Computer Science. As well as the programs and projects I do inside of my degree, I also enjoy working on things outside of my course, which is what I want to show here (mainly seen in the Projects page). I am in my final year of my degree, having just completed an industrial placement at <a href="https://www.cgi.com/en">CGI</a>. This year I have started modules on intelligent robotics and networks and a main focus on my final year project which is based around completing the natural language processing task presented at <a href="https://scienceie.github.io/">SemeVal 2017/ScienceIE</a></p>
                <p>So far, I have had experience in various object orientated programming languages, various web technologies and frameworks and even some functional programming, alongside much industrial development experience as well. With this experience I feel ready and excited to go onto larger projects in the future, learning and doing more interesting things!</p>
                <p>You can check out my <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/tombclarke">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="res/files/CV.pdf">CV</a> and projects all from here.</p>
