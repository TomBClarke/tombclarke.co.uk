            <h2>Computer Science student at the University of Birmingham</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Tom, and I'm currently studying at the University of Birmingham to get a degree in Computer Science. As well as the programs and projects I do inside of my degree, I also enjoy working on things outside of my course, which very soon shall all be shown here. For now you can check out my <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/tombclarke">LinkedIn</a>, my <a href="res/files/CV.pdf">CV</a> or take a look at what I've done over summer at <a href="https://labs.majestic.com">Majestic Labs</a>. I'm looking forward to building my little corner of the internet into a portfolio of my work, and hope to see you again here soon.</p>
            <p>The quickest way to contact me is via email: <a href="mailto:tomclarke96@hotmail.co.uk">Contact me!</a></p>
