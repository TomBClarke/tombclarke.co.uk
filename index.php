                <p>Hi, I'm Tom, and I'm currently studying at the University of Birmingham to get a degree in Computer Science. As well as the programs and projects I do inside of my degree, I also enjoy working on things outside of my course, which is what I want to show here. More accurately, I am currently progressing through my year in industry as part of my degree at <a href="https://www.cgi.com/en">CGI</a> until mid 2017.</p>
                <p>So far, I have had experience in Java, JavaScript (including jQuery and D3.js), C# (used in Unity), MATLAB, OCaml, Haskell and other web technologies. With this experience I feel ready and excited to go onto larger projects in the future, learning more languages and doing more interesting things!</p>
                <p>You can check out my <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/tombclarke">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="res/files/CV.pdf">CV</a> and projects all from here.</p>
