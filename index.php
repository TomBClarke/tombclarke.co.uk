                <p>Hi, I'm Tom, and I'm currently studying at the University of Birmingham to get a degree in Computer Science. As well as the programs and projects I do inside of my degree, I also enjoy working on things outside of my course, which is what I want to show here. Currently, I'm looking for a placement year for the 3rd year of my degree (starting summer 2016) and relevant part time work while at university this year.</p>
                <p>So far, I have had experience in Java, OCaml, various web technologies, and a little bit of C# working in Unity. With this experience I feel ready and excited to go onto larger projects in the future, learning more languages and doing more interesting things!</p>
